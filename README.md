# Creating-Cohorts-of-Songs 

**Problem Scenario:** The customer always looks forward to specialized treatment, whether shopping over an e-commerce website or watching Netflix. They want what they might like to see. To keep the customers engaged, it is also crucial for companies to always present the most relevant information. Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media service provider. The company has over 456 million active monthly users, including over 195 million paying subscribers, as of September 2022. The company intends to create cohorts of different songs that will aid in the recommendation of songs to users based on various relevant features. Each cohort would contain similar types of songs.

**Problem Objective:**
As a data scientist, you should perform exploratory data analysis and perform cluster analysis to create cohorts of songs. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the various factors that contribute to creating a cohort of songs.
